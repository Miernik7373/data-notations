    <h1>Oceans: The Life of Our Planet</h1>
        <p>The world's oceans cover more than 70% of the Earth's surface. They play a
    crucial role in regulating the climate, supporting biodiversity, and providing food for billions of people. However,
    they are facing unprecedented challenges due to pollution, overfishing, and climate change.</p>

    <h2>The Five Oceans</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pacific Ocean></li>
        <li>Atlantic Ocean</li>
        <li>Indian Ocean</li>
        <li>Southern Ocean</li>
        <li>Artic Ocean</li>
    <ul>

    <p>The Pacific Ocean is the largest and deepest ocean, while the Arctic Ocean is the smallest and shallowest. Each
        ocean has its unique ecosystem and plays an essential role in maintaining the balance of life on Earth.</p>

    <h2>The Importance of Oceans</h2>
    <p>Oceans produce more than half of the world's oxygen and absorb a significant portion of carbon dioxide. They are
        home to a wide variety of species, from the tiniest plankton to the largest whales. Without healthy oceans, life
        on land would be impossible.</p>

    <h3>Threats to the Oceans</h3>

    <p>Human activities have put immense pressure on ocean ecosystems. Plastic pollution, for instance, has become a
        massive problem, with millions of tons of plastic entering the oceans every year. It threatens marine life, as
        animals often mistake plastic for food. According to recent studies, by 2050, the ocean could contain more
        plastic than fish by weight. You can read more about this issue <a href="https://example.com/save-the-oceans">here</a>.</p>

    <h3>How You Can Help</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Reduce your use of plastic products.</li>
        <li>Participate in beach clean-up events</li>
        <li>Support organizations working to protect the oceans.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <p>Our oceans are precious resources that must be protected. By taking small steps in our daily lives, we can make a
        big difference in preserving the health of the world's oceans for future generations.</p>
